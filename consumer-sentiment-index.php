                <p><span style="color: #933993; font-weight: 600; font-size: 19px;">Axis My India</span>, a leader in consumer data analytics, presents compelling findings from the latest <span style="color: #933993;">India Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI)</span> that underscore the dynamic shifts in media consumption patterns across Indian households. The data reveals a nuanced change in media engagement, with a slight increase in families consuming various media forms like TV, Internet, and Radio. In the rapidly evolving digital era, marked by the widespread use of smartphones and affordable internet, there is a noticeable shift towards streaming platforms. <span style="color: #933993;">25% of respondents</span> are moving away from traditional cable or satellite subscriptions, embracing the flexibility of digital streaming services. However, traditional media retains its relevance, with 40% of respondents still preferring cable subscriptions, illustrating the coexistence of traditional and digital media formats. The survey further delves into diverse content preferences across different platforms and age groups, highlighting varied interests in <span style="color: #933993;">serials, movies, sports, and both long and short-form videos</span>.</p>
                <p><span style="color: #933993; font-weight: 600; font-size: 19px;">The January net CSI score</span>, calculated by percentage increase minus percentage decrease in sentiment, is at +10.3, which is an increase of +0.3 from the last month.
                </p>
                <p><span style="color: #933993; font-weight: 600; font-size: 19px;">The sentiment analysis</span> delves into five relevant sub-indices – <span style="color: #933993;">Overall household spending, spending on essential and non-essential items, spending on healthcare, media consumption habits, entertainment & tourism trends.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color: #933993; font-weight: 600; font-size: 19px;">The survey used Computer</span> -Aided Telephonic Interviews and included 4603 participants from 35 states and UTs. Among them, 70% were from rural areas and 30% from urban areas. In terms of regions, 25% were from the North, 27% from the East, 31% from the West, and 17% from the South of India. Among the participants, 59% were male and 41% were female. Looking at the largest groups, 28% were aged between 36 and 50 years old, while 27% were aged between 26 and 35 years old.</p>
                <p><span style="color: #933993; font-weight: 600; font-size: 19px;">Commenting on the CSI report, Pradeep Gupta, Chairman & MD, Axis My India, said,</span> "It is clear we're at the dawn of a new era in how content is consumed. The rise of smartphones and accessible internet has ushered in a shift towards streaming platforms, with a significant portion of audiences embracing this new mode of engagement. Yet, importantly, traditional cable remains a steadfast choice for many, suggesting a diverse and multifaceted media landscape. This blend of new and old, from serials to movies, and sports to varied video formats, reveals a rich tapestry of consumer preferences that transcend age groups and traditional norms. Looking ahead, these insights point to a future where media consumption is not about choosing between digital and traditional, but rather about how these mediums can coexist and complement each other.</p>

                            This suggests a fairly even distribution of TV watching habits across different age groups, with a slightly higher inclination in the 36-50 age category.</li>
                            <li>Examining the data on a typical day's OTT viewership, distinct patterns emerge across various age groups:

                            </ul>
                            <li> These findings highlight the varying degrees of adoption of OTT platforms across different age brackets, indicating a higher affinity among younger individuals for on-demand streaming services. This suggests a fairly even distribution of TV watching habits across different age groups, with a slightly higher inclination in the 36-50 age category.</li>
                            
                            <li>The survey shed light on public awareness and participation in the Ayushman Bharat - Jan Arogya Yojana, a pivotal health insurance scheme by the Government of India.

Meanwhile, <span style="color: #933993;">7%</span> of respondents, although aware of the ABHA, do not possess the card.</li>
